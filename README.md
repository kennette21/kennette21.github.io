This is my portfolio site which is currently under construction. 

There are many things I would like to improve about this before I start actively sharing it. Those of note:
1. make the site mobile friendly, better spacing and navigation for single page view.
2. simpler and nicer color/theming
3. incorperate the culture-blog for the explore portion
