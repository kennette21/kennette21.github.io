# Kendama: chasing dopamine
I bought my first Kendama on a day trip to Vienna, Austria. I was going there to buy a Boosted longboard, and the skateshop had Krom Kendamas at the checkout counter.

I really dig the concept of Kendama.

There is so much power in the feeling you get from accomplishing anything. No matter how small, you body, brain, and soul are viserally impacted by the concpet of success. 

I look at kendama as a way to chase this dopamine hit that comes from success.
