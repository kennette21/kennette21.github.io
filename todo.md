## Steps to make this thing badass
- Create a thoughts page
- Top navigator between portfolio, explore, thoughts
- Introduce multiple authors to the page...? Could ask willie for a colab type thing.. maybe if he writes a piece that ties together with something i am doing. A particular project maybe?? They could even write it at the bottom of the project page! How is that different from a comment? Differentiate the two maybe. [multiple authors link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/09-collections/)
- Do some cool CSS to the Project divs
    - make them grow and shrink on mouse over
    - get some cool simple graphics for each one...
    - center everything
    - nice fonts for the whole webpage
    - extend main.html template, and think fo template for proj specfiic pages
- Continue the jekyll tutorial
    - look into how to do a posts page
        - should be able to tag posts so they show up in relevant spaces!
        - I imagine posts to be a section at the bottom: "relevant posts"
- Global naviation bar
    - Header/Footer that allows you to go between the main spaces: Posts, Explo, and Portfolio. Posts can show up in any of the sub pages of Explo or Portfolio. 
- USAGE TRACKING
    - Lookup how to do usage tracking in github pages
    - [add google analytics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17207458/how-to-add-google-analytics-tracking-id-to-github-pages)
- consider SEO and proper sitemapping so this could be discovered [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/)
