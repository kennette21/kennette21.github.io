# Steps to make this thing badass
- Each page has a TODO section and it comes from a data file. An individual TODO can have status and tags which has it show up in certain places. status: done, won't do, todo. tags: projects, project title, UI, general (automatic)
- Introduce multiple authors to the page...? Could ask willie for a colab type thing.. maybe if he writes a piece that ties together with something i am doing. A particular project maybe?? They could even write it at the bottom of the project page! How is that different from a comment? Differentiate the two maybe. [multiple authors link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/09-collections/)
- USAGE TRACKING
    - Lookup how to do usage tracking in github pages
    - [add google analytics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17207458/how-to-add-google-analytics-tracking-id-to-github-pages)
- consider SEO and proper sitemapping so this could be discovered [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/)

# Done stuff
- should be able to tag posts so they show up in relevant spaces!
    - in the data at the top of a file I can add tags. Should keep the list of tags in the _data folder probably.
        - could add a dropdown to a posts page to extend the tags afterwards!
        - even a text entry with ability to add new tags on the fly.
    - I imagine posts to be a section at the bottom: "relevant posts"
- resarch markdown syntx and figure out how to do things like: bookmarks, spacing, url links etceterraaa.
    - how to drop html into md? 
> **ANSWER:** yes you can put html directly into markdown, no need to indicate a switch

- List of all projects on main page: 
    - extend projects
- Create the TBExplore space
- Continue the jekyll tutorial
    - look into how to do a posts page
- Create thoughts, explore, etc
- navigation bar to jump between main pages

- Each Project should link to its own space.
    - that one took a while.

- remove this if .jekyll-cache stops going into git. fix the .gitignore if not.

- Do some cool CSS to the Project divs
    - X make them grow and shrink on mouse over
    - - center everything

- Global naviation bar
    - Header/Footer that allows you to go between the main spaces: Posts, Explo, and Portfolio. Posts can show up in any of the sub pages of Explo or Portfolio.
