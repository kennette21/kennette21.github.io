    <h1>Jarvis</h1>
    <p>Yes, the Jarvis from Iron Man. No, it is not original. Yes Jarvis from Iron Man deserves to be envied.</p>

<p>I want to make a better conversation program for helping with analysis paralyis when trying to decide what to cook, where to eat, or what to do on the weekend.</p>

<p>This consists of a structured list of candidates whether it be constructed from Google Map favorites, foursquare, etc, OR you can use my personal list. I hope it will be a nice list one day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>include some notes drawings?</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="will-it-return">Will it return???</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I hope so. Although natural lanugage processing is difficult. Might just be a click operation thing :()</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-pick-it-back-up">How to pick it back up?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Extend the damn reccomendation lists (recipies, restaurants, and â€¦)</li>
