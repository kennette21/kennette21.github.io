<p>PowWow was a project I did with 6 friends at college. We winded up actually creating a senior entrepeneurship class out of the project and got an office in Downtown Middlebury overlooking the waterfall.</p>

<p>The project was about getting people focused on in person communication in the face of so much technology.</p>

<p>You could active PowWow on your phone and all notifications would be turned off and all messages/calls would recieve an automated busy response.</p>
