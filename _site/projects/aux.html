<h3 id="built-by-jasen-choi-and-tom-bean">Built by Jasen Choi and Tom Bean</h3>
<p>While studying abroad in Budapest at Aquincum Institue of Technology, my roomate and I built a music organization and sharing application. The initial concept was to make listing to music in groups more efficient. One phone is connected to the speaker, but anyone in the room could have good music recomendations for the occasion.</p>

<p>The person playing the music starts an Aux Queue. This Aux Queue can be joined by someone in the group and they can queue up some of their favorite songs. This allows people to share music in groups with more ease.</p>

<h2 id="the-social-aspect">The Social Aspect</h2>
<p>The app could also emulate some of the social aspects of DJing. We all know people who just crush the DJ booth. It is a combination of reading the vibe and having stellar tunes to drive that vibe. People in the group can join the Aux Queue to see the songs being played and vote up or down the current song. Depending on your Aux Queue’s settings, songs with a majority of down votes will be automatically skipped.</p>

<p>With this like and dislike data on user submitted songs, you could develop a user’s DJ ranking. Those who have a good like to dislike ratio are considered good DJs. This data can also be segmented by song genre as well. Some DJs might be great for a calm, chilling vibe while others create bumping party environments.</p>

<p>The crowd could determine which users in the Aux queue should have the next set of time and restrict others from submittings songs.</p>

<h2 id="one-aux-for-all-your-music-platforms">One Aux for all your music platforms.</h2>
<p>As we started building the App we began to realize a secondary benifit of this application. The ability to organize all your music, regardless of the platform, in one place.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo:</h2>
<p>looooking for it…</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-status">What is the Status?!</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we were using Spotify’s API in an innapriate mannor for a production environment. Even if we limit features to make our usage legitament, Spotify and Soundcloud could easily just devlop something similar ontop of our application. Our app could be at the disposal of provider api’s</p>

<p>Make a great prototype and get a job a Spotify.</p>
