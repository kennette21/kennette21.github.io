    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbl4x09_KlQ">Mash Machine</a></p>

<p>I saw the Mash Machine at the Crunch Conference in Budapest. I saw the guy who brought it play a song, and I was hooked. It took the playing out of the music and only left the composition of samples. It quantized everything I believe so it was easy to use.</p>

<p>I guess we talked about how it is working with some people at the conference. The tiles had QR codes and from that point it is pretty straight forward. Detecting the tiles at least. I thought the problem and end product would be very cool… Plus I always wanted to experiment with music making. So I tried to recrate the Mash Machine.</p>

<p>Pictures of attempt: TODO</p>

<h2 id="outstanding-issues">Outstanding Issues</h2>
<p>Quantizing was proving difficult as I was using python and something about the code was making Reaper really lag out. Maybe I could do somethign better with Abelton…?</p>

<h2 id="will-it-return">Will it return???</h2>
<p>Maybe… Hmm it would maybe work with playing with the OP one, and dropping some audio clips…. .HMMM PUTTING AUDIO CLIPS IN IT.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-pick-it-back-up">How to pick it back up?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Reasearch if Ableton has an API</li>
  <li>Consider alternative threaded language that could handle timing better…? Maybe</li>
</ul>

<p>p.s. I was the MC of the Crunch Conference :) [photo] (make this a hover over the Crunch to appear a picture and a caption.)</p>
