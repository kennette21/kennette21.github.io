<h1 id="kendama-tricks">Kendama tricks</h1>
<p>There are different <em>categories</em> or <em>classes</em> of tricks if you will. It depends on your grip, which part of the Kendama you hold, and what movemnts you perform.</p>

<p>The wonderful aspect of these different classes means the toy offers a variaty of perspectives, and enables you to switch from one to another when things get stale.</p>

<p>I will brain dump some categories and some beginner to intermediate moves in each area that I have found.</p>

<p>Could have assignment type things.
You take courses let’s say.. curriculm builds on eachother. You have swimlanes in each of these classes of tricks. You could actually personalize your skill level at the begining. Total beginer starts with basic tricks. They get a page with pictures and an embeded youtube video. They can record from the page/app (optional) :o</p>

<p>Once you complete an asignment, you get… points? gold? (could it be actual gold?)</p>

<h4 id="bit-of-a-quick-digression-about-actual-gold">bit of a quick digression about actual gold:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>if someone submits a video, they could earn actual gold… idea is shot because people who are already good would game the system… unless you could get people to apply to the application saying when they got the toy :D</li>
</ul>

<p>so they just get points in the end. Could also lead to successful streaks, emojis on their home page.</p>

<p>Anyway back  to the mechanics of the app.</p>

<p>You could have different options when asking the app to give you a trick</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edge</li>
  <li>Comfortzone</li>
  <li>Random</li>
  <li>Specific Class:
    <ul>
      <li>Ken</li>
      <li>Tama</li>
      <li>Flip</li>
      <li>Juggle</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>etc…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-jam">The JAM</h3>
<p>Once you select one of those options you enter a “Jam”
The jam shows you a trick, with the video and some fun tips.
Maybe cycling nice quotes that relate to persistance and how you pick up things with time, inspirational (haha)</p>

<h4 id="different-styles-of-proceding-from-trick-to-trick">Different styles of proceding from trick to trick</h4>
<p><em>Stitch a Line</em> (optimised once you use the app a bit and it learns your skills)
Suggest strings of moves that you know. Moves that combo together nicely. Potentially find the the video as well. Or string diagrams together.</p>

<p><em>Down in difficulty</em>
trick feels bananas hard, drop me down the a more foundational trick if possible (data structure of difficulty and class somehow connected is important)</p>

<p><em>Up in difficulty</em> 
I am lacing this bad boy, take me up a notch. (e.g. airplane -&gt; one turn airplane)</p>

<p><em>Shake it up</em>
Getting tired of something, take me to a new class.</p>

<p><em>Take the reins</em>
Specialized to keep you jamming hard. Sometimes shaking it up, sometimes throwing you a line you love, sometimes geting you something new or been strugling on</p>
