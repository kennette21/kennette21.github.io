# IFC
My mom helps run the Iowa Food Cooperative. An online farmers market located in Iowa, where I grew up. 

They needed to create a new software program to expand their business and create a larger outlet for local producers and concious customers.

I did some initial work on designin a better application for them which involved clarifying the Iowa Food Cooperative business and opperations. I produced some documents to describe the process and eventually produced a demo application.

## Outstanding Issues

# How to pick it back up?
