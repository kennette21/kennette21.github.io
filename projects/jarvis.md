Yes, the Jarvis from Iron Man. No, it is not original. Yes Jarvis from Iron Man deserves to be envied. 

I want to make a better conversation program for helping with analysis paralyis when trying to decide what to cook, where to eat, or what to do on the weekend. 

This consists of a structured list of candidates whether it be constructed from Google Map favorites, foursquare, etc, OR you can use my personal list. I hope it will be a nice list one day.

- include some notes drawings?

## Outstanding Issues
- need to incorprate some recursion 

## Will it return???
- I hope so. Although natural lanugage processing is difficult. Might just be a click operation thing :()


# How to pick it back up?
- Extend the damn reccomendation lists (recipies, restaurants, and ...)
- Incorprate recursion so the user can stop in the middle of the list.
