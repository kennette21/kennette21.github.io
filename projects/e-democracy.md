As my senior thesis at Middlebury College I built a proof of concept for a decentralaized voting platform built ontop of Ethereum

## Outstanding Issues
It never really worked that well. Working with Etherum's blockchain was a mystery and my friend, Connor O'day did all of that :) 

## Will it return???

# How to pick it back up?
Work for an etherum startup doing the same thing
