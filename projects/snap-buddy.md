I created a robotic mount for a camera tripod in order to take more interesting and dynamic Snap Chats.

#### 4 years later, i stand by my original comment

## TODO: Proximity Olympics video.

## Outstanding Issues
its in some dusty box in the back of the garage.

## Will it return???
Probably honestly, having a remote movable camera mount is very useful. I had a version 2 drawn up that i never ended up making....
picture here if you find it.

# How to pick it back up?
Work on designs for a more stable base.
