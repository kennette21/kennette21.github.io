# PowWow

PowWow was a project I did with 6 friends at college. We winded up actually creating a senior entrepeneurship class out of the project and got an office in Downtown Middlebury overlooking the waterfall.

The project was about getting people focused on in person communication in the face of so much technology.

You could active PowWow on your phone and all notifications would be turned off and all messages/calls would recieve an automated busy response.
