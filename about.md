# Me
I grew up on a farm in Iowa
I currently live in Budapest, Hungary working as a Software Developer.

I love to build things and learn how stuff works.

# The Concept of this Place
This is a public page where I share my projects: past, present and future.

I will also display arbitrary parts of my life or things I find interesting.

# The Why
In an effort to keep my hobbies fun, I work on anythign that excites me in the moment. This can be detrimental to progress for many reasons, two main ones: 

1. Picking up a project that has been dormant for a while
2. Actually wrapping up a project so it can be presented

I want to use this portfolio to keep myself accountable while I work. 

One way is through documenting my days of works as thoughts, so I can go back and refresh myself.

Another is to display milestones here to give myself that feeling of completion that is so wonderful to shoot for.
