# The Concept
This is a public page where I share my projects: past, present and future.

I will also display arbitrary parts of my life or things I find interesting.

# The Why
I find myself working on fun and exciting projects. I get pretty far with some, far enough for it to be considered a "success," or at least marginally interesting.

In an effort to keep my hobbies fun, I work on anythign that excites me in the moment. This leads to starting many projects and working on existing ones speratically.

Two challenges I face:
1. Picking the project up after being away from it for some time
2. Wrapping a project in a professional manner in order to showcase it

While I am working on the project, I am in the context, so I remember all the special things I have to do to make it work. After some time, I stop working on it and forget how to continue on effectively. I believe it is only 10% more work most of the time to wrap the project up, make it presentable. I hope this concious wrapping up effort will make it easier to return to past work.
