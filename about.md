# Me

I grew up on a farm in Iowa
I currently live in Budapest, Hungary working as a Software Developer.

I love to build things and learn how stuff works.

# The Concept of this Place

This is a public page where I share my projects: past, present and future.

Along with projects, I will write nad post about thoughts and concepts I find stimulating.

# Why

A friend described the difference between work and hobby as the presence of strict deadlines, or lack there of.

In an effort to keep my hobbies, hobbistical, I work on anything that excites me in the moment. I try to avoid setting hard deadlines for things I do outside of work. I work on these ideas simply for the joy of finding things out and the process of building/creating.

In my heart I still agree with this appraoch, but there are two major problems I battle with today:

1. Picking up a project that has been dormant for a while
2. Portraying my work so others can enjoy and appriciate what I've done

I plan to use this portfolio as an attempt to address both these issues by:

-   briefly journaling ideas and intentions about my work as i go along in the form of **thoughts**
-   constantly keeping the project page up to date with major achievements/changes to the application.
