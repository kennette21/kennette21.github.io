## This is the about page
### The concept
I would like to make a public page where I share my projects: past, present and future.

I would also like to show more arbitrary parts of my life or things I find interesting.

### The Why
I find myself working on fun and exciting projects. I get pretty far with some, far enough for it to be considered a "success," or at least marginally interesting.

Two challenges I face:
1. Picking the project up after taking some time off, working on something else
2. Wrapping the project in a professional manner in order to present it to other people.

While I am working on the project, I am in the context, so I remember all the special things I have to do to make it work. After some time, I will stop working on the project for a while, and forget how to continue on effectively. I believe it is only 10% more work most of the time to wrap the project up, make it presentable, and final enough to come back and extend.
