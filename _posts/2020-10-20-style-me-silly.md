# style-me-silly
This will be an effort to make the UI a little more attractive. Some ideas to start.
1. figure out the components we have to show on the screen:
- input boxes
- button
- ...

look up some styled component templates maybe?

going to try to focus on each page nad style accordingly

moving to the strategy of modifying fancy background to maybe just be a color strip on the bottom.. or side.. both..?

alright sort of went iwth a floating box instead.. making some progress but nothing crazy :/... i guess this will just be a work in progress. 

over and out
..............

And we back the next day! gonna keep plugging away

First step is making this damn svg appear

ended up styling quite a bit :). looks a bit crazy, but i guess better than before!

now going to quickly setup the firebase deployment, and good to gooo!
