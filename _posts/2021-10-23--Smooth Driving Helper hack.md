# Smooth Driving Helper hack
```
This is the fallback Template.
Create your own template, see help!
```

I had an idea to build an app that uses acceleromiter data to warn you how irradic your driving is. E.g. tell how much acceleration is being experienced in the car. 

I thought it was straight forwarda and it proved to be! I just build it with flutter, debugged on my phone to an MVP, and then i installed it on my phone :D i can't wait to try it tomorrow!
