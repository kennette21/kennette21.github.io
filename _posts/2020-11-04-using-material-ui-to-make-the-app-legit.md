# using-material-ui-to-make-the-app-legit

I would like to introduce material UI to the culture blog so i do not need to keep writing the UI components by hand using styled components. I am hoping this brings a more consistent feel to the whole thing.

currently feeling lik a total bum

I do not understand how these damn style systems work or how they offer benifit to ui development.`
