## Lets ride
### starting with the footer


inintial notes from file:

 * adding users to the "the"
 * 
 * add a dropdown component instead of the the.
 * The options are all the users in the culture blog
 * 
 * When you select on you only see those users currated posts
 * 
 * change the url to something like:
 * www.{the}.cultureblog.com
 * www.cultureblog.{the}.com
 * www.the.cultureblog.com/{the}/{category}
 * ??? probably the third is easiest
